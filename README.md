# Crash API

API and data import for DVRPC's crash data.

Front end repo is at https://github.com/dvrpc/crash-data-tool.

See the [API](api/README.md) and [Data](data/README.md) READMEs for additional information.

Note: the API will be automatically redeployed upon a successful pull request merge via a Webhook (in conjunction with the [automated deployments API](https://github.com/dvrpc/automated-deployments-api) and the [cloud-ansible](https://github.com/dvrpc/cloud-ansible) project, with results emailed to those monitoring such activities.
