      <p>In transportation planning, crash data is a vital resource for identifying crash trends and needed safety improvements. DVRPC is consistent with state and local partners by employing a Vision Zero approach to crash data analysis: no loss of life in our region's roadways is acceptable. Roadway owners and policymakers should focus on preventing crashes that result in fatalities or serious injuries - the most severe crashes on the road.</p>
      <span>Injury severity from crashes is divided into seven possible categories:</span>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Fatality</strong>: Fatalities stemming from crashes may occur up to 30 days following the crash for the injury to be coded as fatal.</li>
        <li><strong>Suspected Serious Injury</strong>: The responding police officer suspects that the person sustained a serious, often incapacitating, injury.</li>
        <li><strong>Suspected Minor Injury</strong>: The responding police officer suspects that the person sustained an injury less sever than a serious injury, and the injury is "evident".</li>
        <li><strong>Possible Injury</strong>: The responding police officer suspects that the person sustained an injury of low severity, sometimes a "complaint of pain," and the injury is not readily evident.</li>
        <li><strong>Not Injured</strong>: The responding police officer does not suspect that the person was injuried.
          <ul>
            <li>In <strong>Pennsylvania</strong>, if no one was injured than at least one vehicle must require a tow from the scene of the crash for that crash to be considered "reportable."</li>
            <li> In <strong>New Jersey</strong> a crash is "reportable" if any one person involved is injured, or if there is damage to property of $500 or more.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Unknown Injury</strong>: An injury is suspected but the severity of the injury is unknown.</li>
        <li><strong>Unknown if Injured</strong>: Data is unavailable regarding whether the person was injured.</li>
      </ol>
